# git-bomb

An electron-based application which will run `git reset --hard`
on a specified directory every X minutes.

## Wha-? I don't even...

Why would anyone ever want to do this?
Adding this constraint to your development flow may help you
think in smaller units and make atomic commits.
Instead of thinking about "losing work", consider it a way to
experiment with code until you get something really good.
What you've learned is more important than specific lines of code,
and sometimes you can write better code faster after the reset.

Running `git reset --hard` every X minutes is sometimes used
during Global Day of Code Retreat exercises.
Give it a try with a code kata!
